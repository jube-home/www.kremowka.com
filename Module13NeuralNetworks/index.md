# Module 13: Neural Networks

Neural networks are a universal predictive analytics method, if a little unexplainable when they grow large.  Unlike many of the predictive analytics techniques presented, Neural Networks are as equally good at classification problems as they are prediction problems.  This module will use dataset used beforehand, seeking to showcase the improvement that can be obtained in using Neural Networks, albeit with an increase in complexity and explainability.
