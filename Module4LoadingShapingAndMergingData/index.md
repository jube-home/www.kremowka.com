# Module 4: Loading, Shaping and Merging Data

Abstraction, the process of shaping and moulding raw data to enhance relevance prior to it being presented to machine learning algorithms, is the cornerstone of the methodologies put forward in these procedures.

The procedures that follow set out the means to load data into R, and when this data resides in R, sets forth procedures to shape and mould the data in as part of abstraction.

Most generally in Jube procedures and methodology Abstraction is offloaded to Relational Database Management platforms, the shaping and moulding of data in R tends to be to augment these core datasets.
