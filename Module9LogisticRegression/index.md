# Module 9: Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a modelling technique that can be used for classification where the dependent variable values are binary, 1 or 0 as such.  The dataset that is used in this module is available under \Bundle\Data\FraudRisk\FraudRisk.csv which contains a set of debit card transactions whereby half of the dataset is a sample of fraudulent transactions, half of the dataset is a sample of legitimate transactions. 

To proceed with the subsequent procedures, it is necessary to import the file FraudRisk.csv into R.
